The legal basis for NUTS is Regulation (EC) No 1059/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 May 2003 on the establishment of a common classification of territorial units for statistics (NUTS). 

NUTS version 2021 has been developed on the basis of the sixth amendment to the annexes, that was adopted by Commission Delegated Regulation 2019/1755, entered into force on 2019-08-08 and applied, with regard to the transmission of data to the Commission (Eurostat), from 2021-01-01. To meet the demand for statistics at a local level, Eurostat maintains a system of Local Administrative Units (LAUs) compatible with NUTS. In addition, since some data collections use postcodes to reference the geographic location, Eurostat has established a link between postcodes and NUTS level 3 codes in order to exploit information which originally is coded only by postcodes.	null	publish	true	Eurostat	2023-04-01T22:00:00.000000Z	2023-01-26T18:18:06.000000Z	2025-01-16T14:38:36.000000Z

It is an economic indicator that measures the change over time of the prices of consumer goods and services acquired by households. In other words, it is a set of consumer price indices (CPIs) calculated according to a harmonised approach and a set of definitions as laid down in Regulations and Recommendations.
In addition, the HICP provides the official measure of consumer price inflation in the [euro area](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Glossary:Euro_area) for the purposes of monetary policy and the assessment of inflation convergence as required under the Maastricht criteria for accession to the euro.	null	publish	true	CC BY 4.0	2025-01-15T23:00:00.000000Z	2025-01-16T11:13:21.000000Z	2025-08-27T13:40:08.000000Z
