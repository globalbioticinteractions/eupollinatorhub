Prior to commercial production, information on their breeding and pollination system is essential to ensure sustainable management. We conducted pollination experiments and observed flower visitors in an experimental double-cropping system in southern Germany. We found that common camelina varieties were mainly self-pollinated and yield of one variety seemed to benefit from insect visitation, whereas pennycress was predominantly wind pollinated. Camelina showed higher overall visitation rates by insects than pennycress. Flie

In this review, we expand the previous estimates using novel primary data from 200 countries and found that fruit, vegetable or seed production from 87 of the leading global food crops is dependent upon animal pollination, while 28 crops do not rely upon animal pollination. However, global production volumes give a contrasting perspective, since 60\% of global production comes from crops that do not depend on animal pollination, 35\% from crops that depend on pollinators, and 5\% are unevaluated.

A) The research was carried out at Figino (province of Alessandria) in 1979 and 1980 and at Schierano (province of Asti) in 1980. The number of individuals of the various kinds of pollinators, that visited the flowers on sample areas of ordinary crops at different times of the day and in successive periods of the flowering season, were counted and their behaviour was observed. The results for the various sites of observation were quite homogeneous; most frequently observed was Apis millifera(50-64\% of the presences recorded), which gathered only nectar, Bombus pascuorum, B. terrestris and B. lapidarius, which gathered especially in the morning hours and also collected pollen. B. terrestris also visited the flowers without entering them, by simply biting a hole at the base of the corolla. B) The effect of the bees on seed yield from plants grown under net cages was checked in Figino, in 1979, and in Schierano, in 1980 and 1981. In any case the seed production in the plants to which bees had no access to was very low. Comparison between the plants caged with bees and those grown in the open field gave results that differed over the years, presumably because natural pollinators, prevalently bees, intervened to differing extents. C) The frequency of cross pollination was observed in plants of «Bianco di Spagna» grown in alternate rows, 1-2-3-4 m apart with plants of «Valloriate», an ecotype with dark seed and reddish brown stem, at Schierano in the three-year period 1982-1984. The results show that cross pollination frequencies between the two genotypes varied from 2 to 10\%, the lower percentages being found where the distance between the rows was greater.}, 	number = {1}, 	urldate = {2023-07-18}, 	journal = {Advances in Horticultural Science}, 	author = {Quagliotti, L. and Marletto, F.}, 	year = {1987}, 	note = {Publisher: Dipartimento Di Scienze Delle Produzioni Vegetali, Del Suolo E Dell'Ambiente Agroforestale, University of Florence}, 	pages = {43--49}, }
