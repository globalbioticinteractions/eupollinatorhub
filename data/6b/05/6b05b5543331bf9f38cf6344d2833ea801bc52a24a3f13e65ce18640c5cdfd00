Varroa samples were collected from citizen and mined data using 3 standard method sources between the years 2012-2020. This data contains 11124 varroa sampling events. Roughly 21% of these events record zero mites present. The highest number of mites present in a single sampling event is 5016. Sampling events are collected from 04\/02\/12 to 11\/11\/20, and last on average 7.2 days each (range: 1.0-23.8 days). Roughly 75% of Varroa Sampling events occur between 3 and 9 days.\n\nData on mite infestation levels were collected from 3 sources by a standard method - natural mite falls - from 2012 to 2020, mainly in the spring, early summer, and late summer. Data were collected from 3 different sources of differing quality. Data from the highest quality, described as quality_control=2, was examined with the BeeVS diagnostic system (Apisfero, Turin, Italy), which consists of a high-resolution scanner to take a picture of the samples (sticky boards placed under the brood nest of colonies) and cloud-based software used to count the number of mites on the sticky boards. Data from the intermediate source is described as quality_control=1 and were examined manually by a trained group. Data from the poorest quality source is described as quality_control=0 and were examined manually by untrained individuals according to a classification scheme. Data was entered via a web terminal by whomever analyzed the sample. The software vetted the data for plausibility (rejection of values that exceed 100 mites\/day) and completeness (rejection of values that did not fall between a 3 day and 21-day measuring interval). Data exceeding these limits, which can be found in the data set, has been imported from external resources and has been approved by the supervisor. The data collected by untrained individuals were checked by the supervisor for plausibility.\n\nFrom 2012 to 2016 the project was only implemented in the Austrian province of Styria, where approximately 3500 beekeepers supervised 53000 to 56000 honeybee colonies. In 2017 the crowdsourcing initiative was extended to all nine Austrian provinces, consisting of 28032 to 30237 beekeepers and 329402 to 390607 honeybee colonies in their care.\n\nThe total number of samples collected is 11124. 4033 (36%) were medium quality samples (QC=1) and 3267 (29%) were high quality samples (QC=2).\n\nThe varroa survey dataset includes 99 users (beekeepers), 242 bee yards (apiaries), and 2,116\nhives from the nine Austrian provinces for a total of 11124 records pertaining to varroa infestation.","featured_image":null,"structure":null,"preparation":null,"changes":null,"unresolved":null,"additional_information":null,"type":"file","licence":null,"columns":[{"links":[],"id":1185,"name":"sampling_id","description":"The sampling event identifier","descriptor":{"links":[],"id":489,"uid":"0.0.MTRLS489","namespace":"dwc","name":"materialSampleID","description":"A term from the [Darwin Core standard](https:\/\/dwc.tdwg.org\/list\/#dwc_materialSampleID):\n\n> An identifier for the [dwc:MaterialSample](https:\/\/app.pollinatorhub.eu\/vocabulary\/classes\/7551) (as opposed to a particular digital record of the [dwc:MaterialSample](https:\/\/app.pollinatorhub.eu\/vocabulary\/classes\/7551)).

String may also denote more general arrays or other sequence (or list) data types and structures.","notes":null,"examples":null,"class":"[EUPH-code: 7322]","unit":null,"deprecated":false,"created_at":null,"updated_at":"2024-09-14T11:17:02.000000Z"},{"links":[],"uid":"0.0.DATEA317","namespace":"iso-8601","name":"calendarDate","description":"> particular [calendar day](https:\/\/app.pollinatorhub.eu\/vocabulary\/classes\/3349) [...] represented by its [calendar year](https:\/\/app.pollinatorhub.eu\/vocabulary\/classes\/3321) [...], its [calendar month](https:\/\/app.pollinatorhub.eu\/vocabulary\/classes\/3342) [...] and its [calendar day of month](https:\/\/app.pollinatorhub.eu\/vocabulary\/classes\/7407) [...]","notes":"Recommended best practice is to provide the date in the [extended format](https:\/\/app.pollinatorhub.eu\/vocabulary\/classes\/868), as proposed by ISO 8601 ([YYYY][\"-\"][MM][\"-\"][DD]), where [YYYY] is a format representation of a [calendar year](https:\/\/app.pollinatorhub.eu\/vocabulary\/classes\/3321), [MM] is a format representation of a [calendar month](https:\/\/app.pollinatorhub.eu\/vocabulary\/classes\/3342) and [DD] is a format representation of a [calendar day](https:\/\/app.pollinatorhub.eu\/vocabulary\/classes\/3349).","examples":"* 2025-03-13","class":"[EUPH-code: 7408]","unit":null,"deprecated":false,"created_at":null,"updated_at":"2025-03-13T09:40:28.000000Z"},{"links":[],"uid":"0.0.LNGTD332","namespace":"dwc","name":"decimalLongitude","description":"A term from the [Darwin Core standard](https:\/\/dwc.tdwg.org\/list\/#dwc_decimalLongitude):\n> The geographic longitude (in decimal degrees, using the spatial reference system given in [dwc:geodeticDatum](https:\/\/app.pollinatorhub.eu\/vocabulary\/classes\/7491)) of the geographic center of a [dcterms:Location](https:\/\/app.pollinatorhub.eu\/vocabulary\/classes\/7367).
