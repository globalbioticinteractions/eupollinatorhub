The latter may allow its elements to be mutated and the length changed, or it may be fixed (after creation). A string is generally considered as a data type and is often implemented as an array data structure of bytes (or words) that stores a sequence of elements, typically characters, using some character encoding. String may also denote more general arrays or other sequence (or list) data types and structures.","notes":null,"examples":null,"class":"[EUPH-code: 7322]","unit":null,"deprecated":false,"created_at":null,"updated_at":"2024-09-14T11:17:02.000000Z"},{"links":[],"uid":"0.0.DATEA317","namespace":"iso-8601","name":"calendarDate","description":"> particular [calendar day](https:\/\/app.pollinatorhub.eu\/vocabulary\/classes\/3349) [...] represented by its [calendar year](https:\/\/app.pollinatorhub.eu\/vocabulary\/classes\/3321) [...], its [calendar month](https:\/\/app.pollinatorhub.eu\/vocabulary\/classes\/3342) [...] and its [calendar day of month](https:\/\/app.pollinatorhub.eu\/vocabulary\/classes\/7407) [...]","notes":"Recommended best practice is to provide the date in the [extended format](https:\/\/app.pollinatorhub.eu\/vocabulary\/classes\/868), as proposed by ISO 8601 ([YYYY][\"-\"][MM][\"-\"][DD]), where [YYYY] is a format representation of a [calendar year](https:\/\/app.pollinatorhub.eu\/vocabulary\/classes\/3321), [MM] is a format representation of a [calendar month](https:\/\/app.pollinatorhub.eu\/vocabulary\/classes\/3342) and [DD] is a format representation of a [calendar day](https:\/\/app.pollinatorhub.eu\/vocabulary\/classes\/3349).","examples":"* 2025-03-13","class":"[EUPH-code: 7408]","unit":null,"deprecated":false,"created_at":null,"updated_at":"2025-03-13T09:40:28.000000Z"},{"links":[],"uid":"0.0.SCNTF503","namespace":"dwc","name":"scientificName","description":"A term from the [Darwin Core standard](https:\/\/dwc.tdwg.org\/list\/#dwc_scientificName):\n\n> The full scientific name, with authorship and date information if known.
