The Organization for Standardization (ISO) is an important source for internationally recognized standards, for some of which ISO grants free-of-charge use. ISO-3166 is an internationally recognised and adopted, free-of-charge standard for country codes and their subdivisions. Its purpose is to provide codes of letters and numbers, which can \u2013 and should \u2013 be used when referring to countries and their subdivisions. The standard does not include the name of the countries, which have been imported from the Standard country or area codes for statistical use (M49) of the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD).\nThe dataset contains ISO-3166 country codes published by and the Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the names of countries published by the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) of the entire world, which are currently in use, for internal use on the EU Pollinator Hub.\n","acquisition":"Raw data, containing part of the data contained in \u201cISO 3166-1:2020 Codes for the representation of names of countries and their subdivisions \u2014 Part 1: Country code\u201d published by the Organization for Standardization (ISO), was manually sampled from the web page Online Browsing Platform (OBP) [1] on 2022-11-14 after selecting \u2018Country codes\u2019 from the main list, \u2018Officially assigned codes\u2019, \u2018Formerly used\u2019, \u2018Transitionally reserved\u2019 and \u2018Exceptionally reserved\u2019 as Code type and following the individual link provided for each country contained in the list. \u2018Indeterminately reserved\u2019 and \u2018Unassigned\u2019 code types were not integrated in the dataset.
