The legal basis for NUTS is Regulation (EC) No 1059\/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 May 2003 on the establishment of a common classification of territorial units for statistics (NUTS). \n\nNUTS version 2021 has been developed on the basis of the sixth amendment to the annexes, that was adopted by Commission Delegated Regulation 2019\/1755, entered into force on 2019-08-08 and applied, with regard to the transmission of data to the Commission (Eurostat), from 2021-01-01. To meet the demand for statistics at a local level, Eurostat maintains a system of Local Administrative Units (LAUs) compatible with NUTS. In addition, since some data collections use postcodes to reference the geographic location, Eurostat has established a link between postcodes and NUTS level 3 codes in order to exploit information which originally is coded only by postcodes.","featured_image":null,"data_overview":null,"data_value":null,"data_description":null,"data_application":null,"data_issues":null,"introduction":null,"acquisition":null,"preparation":null,"validation":null,"analysis":null,"status":"publish","public":true,"licence":{"links":[],"uid":"eurostat","name":"Eurostat","abbreviation":"Eurostat","description":"Eurostat has a policy of encouraging free re-use of its data, both for non-commercial and commercial purposes.

The permission granted above does not extend to any material whose copyright is identified as belonging to a third-party, such as photos or illustrations from copyright holders other than the European Union. In these circumstances, authorisation must be obtained from the relevant copyright holder(s).\n2. Logos and trademarks are excluded from the above mentioned general permission, except if they are redistributed as an integral part of a Eurostat publication and if the publication is redistributed unchanged.\n3. When reuse involves translations of publications or modifications to the data or text, this must be stated clearly to the end user of the information. A disclaimer regarding the non-responsibility of Eurostat shall be included.\n4. The following Eurostat data and documents may not be reused for commercial purposes (but non-commercial reuse is possible without restriction):\n\ta. Data identified as belonging to sources other than Eurostat; all data published on Eurostat's website can be regarded as belonging to Eurostat for the purpose of their reuse, with the exceptions stated below, or if it is explicitly stated otherwise.\n\tb. Publications or documents where the copyright belongs partly or wholly to other organisations, for example concerning co-publications between Eurostat and other publishers.\n\tc. Data on countries other than\n        - Member States of the European Union (EU), and\n        - Member States of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), and\n        - official EU acceding and candidate countries.\n        Examples are data on the United States of America, Japan or China. Often, such data are included in Eurostat data tables. In such cases, a re-user would need to eliminate such data from the tables before reusing them commercially.\n\td. Trade data originating from Liechtenstein and Switzerland (as declaring countries), from 1995 onwards, and concerning the following commodity classifications: HS, SITC, BEC, NSTR and national commodity classifications. Thus it is, for example, not allowed to sell export\/import data declared by Switzerland (concerning the above named commodity classifications). However, it is allowed to sell Swiss export\/import data declared by an EU Member State (but see below a similar exception for Austria).\n\te. Trade data originating from Austria (as a declaring country) for a level of detail of the Combined Nomenclature of 8 digits; again, it is not allowed to sell export\/import declared by Austria (concerning the above named commodity classifications), but it is allowed to sell Austrian export\/import data declared by another EU Member State.\n\n### What to do if you want to re-use Eurostat material for commercial purposes\n\nThere is no special procedure or requirement for a written licence. Just download the material and use it (unless the material is listed in the exceptions above).\n\n### Legal notice of the European Commission\n\nThe basis for the copyright and licence policy of Eurostat is the legal notice of the European Commission 'Europa website' which can be found here: https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/legal-notice_en\n\n### Political context\n\nThis approach implements the policy of the European Statistical System (ESS), adopted in February 2013, under which the ESS has committed itself to provide its statistics free of charge as a public good of high quality,
