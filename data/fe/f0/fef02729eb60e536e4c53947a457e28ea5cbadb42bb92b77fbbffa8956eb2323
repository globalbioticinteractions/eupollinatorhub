The metadatafile *meta-data-weather-tier-1-b-good.xlsx* was used as a  guideline. Subsequently, each data column header in the raw data file was substituted by the relevant common column header. \n\nAll processed raw data files were then exported from MS Excel in CSV format (utf-8 encoding) and imported into into a SQL database (MariaDB foundation, server version 10.4.32) running in an XAMPP environment (BitRock, version 5.2.1). Depending on the year of data acquisition, the record were then divided into one table that contained only data from 2020 and one table that contained data from 2021 (including 2 records from 2022). Each table was then exported to the preparatory files *weather 2020PREPMR241014.csv* and *weather 2021PREPMR241014.csv*, respectively, which were subsequently imported into the EU Pollinator Hub.\n\nData was then exported to the respective preparatory files and uploaded to the EU Pollinator Hub according to [SOP-017 (Dataset integration](https:\/\/app.pollinatorhub.eu\/pages\/sop-directory).","validation":"No data validation was performed.","analysis":"No data analysis was performed.","status":"publish","public":true,"licence":{"links":[],"uid":"cc-by-nc-nd-4-0","name":"CC BY-NC-ND 4.0","abbreviation":"CC BY-NC-ND 4.0","description":"### You are free to:\n\n* Share \u2014 copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format.\n* The licensor cannot revoke these freedoms as long as you follow the license terms.\n\n### Under the following terms:\n\n* Attribution - You must give appropriate credit , provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made.
