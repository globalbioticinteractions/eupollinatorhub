According to Article 18 the following notifiable honey bee diseases are listed in annex II: infestation with Varroa spp. (Varroosis), infestation with Aethina tumida (Small hive beetle), American foulbrood, infestation with Tropilaelaps spp.\nIn Belgium, until 10.06.2022 notification of honey bee diseases was regulated by the animal health law (dierengezondheidswet \/ loi relative \u00e0 la sant\u00e9 des animaux), which entered into force on 27.04.1987 (law no. 19870106057). The following diseases had to be notified: infestation with the tracheal mite (Acarapis woodi), American foulbrood (Paenibacillus larvae), European foulbrood (Melissococcus plutonius), infestation with the small hive beetle (Aethina tumida), infestation with Tropilaelaps mites (Tropilaelaps spp). Since 17.07.2014 (law no. 2014024272) Varroosis has been removed from the list of notifiable diseases.\nIn Austria notification of honey bee diseases is currently regulated in the bee disease law (Bundesgesetz vom 25. Mai 1988 \u00fcber die Bek\u00e4mpfung ansteckender Krankheiten der Bienen; Bienenseuchengesetz), which entered into force on 25.05.1988 (law no. 290\/1988). The following diseases have to be notified: American foulbrood (Paenibacillus larvae), infestation with the small hive beetle (Aethina tumida), infestation with Tropilaelaps mites (Tropilaelaps spp), Varroosis in case of an imminent or actual death of at least 30% of the colonies in an apiary. Since 05.07.2005 (law no. 67\/2005) Nosemosis has been removed from the list of notifiable diseases.

Data from 2021 [7] and 2022 [8] was obtained from summary animal health reports available at the same location. Data on notified outbreaks of honey bee diseases for Belgium were obtained from a website provided by the Belgium food safety authority (Agence F\u00e9d\u00e9rale pour la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la Cha\u00eene Alimentaire, FAVV-AFSCA) [9].
