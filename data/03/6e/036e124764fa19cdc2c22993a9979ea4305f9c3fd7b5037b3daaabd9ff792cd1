This lack of data is partly due to the fact, that for the great majority of individuals beekeeping is a leisure activity and their considerable economic output is not recorded, partly also due to a lack of awareness for the value of data driven decisions. The current dataset has been collected by the Austrian beekeeping federation *Biene \u00d6sterreich* to accelerate the production of annual reports on the Austrian beekeeping sector and requires regular manual update.","acquisition":"Data was obtained from several sources by the Austrian beekeeping federation Biene \u00d6sterreich.
