The end product of deliverable D3.1 is a \u201cDatabase of major crop, forest and wild species that compose each landscape element type and that are a relevant resource for honey bees\u201d. This deliverable has a double function, being simultaneously a Report and a Database. These two standalone components (the Report and the Database) that can be consulted independently or together for further contextualization and details. The Report contains the methodology and an overview of the relevant resources for honey bees. The Database is currently deposited in the B-GOOD data portal (https:\/\/beehealthdata.org\/) and follows the structure described in section 2.6 of the Report. The Database has the full details about plant species occurrence, average plant species cover and habitat plant species composition, together with the information about the bee-friendliness value of each plant (considering its characteristics independent of the habitat) but also the bee-friendliness of each plant species when considering its occurrence and cover within each habitat. The methods applied for this deliverable are presented and described in the Methodology section of the Report (section 2). After that section, an overview of the main resources for honey bees present in each habitat is shown in the Report (section 3). To contextualise the Deliverable, the integration of Task 3.1 within the entire WP3 strategy is initially explained in a comprehensive workflow diagram of WP3 in the Introduction section of the Report (section 1).\n\nThe main objective of WP3 is to develop a dynamic landscape model across the EU capturing the major floral resources for bees (flower resource model) considered a key driver of bee health status. To achieve this major goal, in task 3.1 the main landscape elements important for bees across Europe were identified and classified in terms of plant composition. In future tasks 3.2 and 3.3 the value in terms of pollen and nectar and phenology will be attributed. To identify the main landscape elements and their composition in terms of plant communities, several data sources and tools were used following the methodology presented in this report.\nIt includes different procedures and data sources aiming to identify the plant composition of each landscape habitat, and to produce a database of major crop, forest and wild species that compose each landscape element type and that are a relevant resource for honey bees. This report and the associated database are the major outputs of task 3.1, and contain the identification and the ranking of plant species and habitats in terms of important resources for honey bees.\n","acquisition":"All raw data files were downloaded from the [B-GOOD Bee Health Data Portal](https:\/\/beehealthdata.org) on 2024-09-26 18:15:28.\n\n**List of raw data obtained from the data provider.**\n1.
