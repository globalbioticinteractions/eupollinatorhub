The latter may allow its elements to be mutated and the length changed, or it may be fixed (after creation). A string is generally considered as a data type and is often implemented as an array data structure of bytes (or words) that stores a sequence of elements, typically characters, using some character encoding. String may also denote more general arrays or other sequence (or list) data types and structures.","notes":null,"examples":null,"class":"[EUPH-code: 7322]","unit":null,"deprecated":false,"created_at":null,"updated_at":"2024-09-14T11:17:02.000000Z"},{"links":[],"uid":"0.0.DTNDT319","namespace":"iso-8601","name":"calendarDateAndTime","description":"> [date and time representation](https:\/\/app.pollinatorhub.eu\/vocabulary\/classes\/741) [...] that includes all the [time scale components](https:\/\/app.pollinatorhub.eu\/vocabulary\/classes\/736) [...] associated with the [expression](https:\/\/app.pollinatorhub.eu\/vocabulary\/classes\/676) [...]","notes":"Recommended best practice is to provide the [complete representation](https:\/\/app.pollinatorhub.eu\/vocabulary\/classes\/755) of date and time in the [extended format](https:\/\/app.pollinatorhub.eu\/vocabulary\/classes\/868), as proposed by ISO 8601 ([YYYY][\"-\"][MM][\"-\"][DD] [hh][\":\"][mm][\":\"][ss]), where [YYYY] is a format representation of a [calendar year](https:\/\/app.pollinatorhub.eu\/vocabulary\/classes\/3321), [MM] is a format representation of a [calendar month](https:\/\/app.pollinatorhub.eu\/vocabulary\/classes\/3342), [DD] is a format representation of a [calendar day](https:\/\/app.pollinatorhub.eu\/vocabulary\/classes\/3349), [hh] is a format representation of a [clock hour](https:\/\/app.pollinatorhub.eu\/vocabulary\/classes\/7402), [mm] is a format representation of a [clock minute](https:\/\/app.pollinatorhub.eu\/vocabulary\/classes\/7404), and [ss] is a format representation of a [clock second](https:\/\/app.pollinatorhub.eu\/vocabulary\/classes\/7405).","examples":"* 2025-03-13 10:34:12","class":"[EUPH-code: 755]","unit":null,"deprecated":false,"created_at":null,"updated_at":"2025-03-13T09:40:26.000000Z"},{"links":[],"uid":"0.0.LNGTD332","namespace":"dwc","name":"decimalLongitude","description":"A term from the [Darwin Core standard](https:\/\/dwc.tdwg.org\/list\/#dwc_decimalLongitude):\n> The geographic longitude (in decimal degrees, using the spatial reference system given in [dwc:geodeticDatum](https:\/\/app.pollinatorhub.eu\/vocabulary\/classes\/7491)) of the geographic center of a [dcterms:Location](https:\/\/app.pollinatorhub.eu\/vocabulary\/classes\/7367).
