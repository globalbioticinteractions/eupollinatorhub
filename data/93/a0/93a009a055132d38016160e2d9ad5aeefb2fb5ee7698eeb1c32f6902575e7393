Several databases for crop production and classification as well as animal and plant species taxonomy and occurrence exist. To our knowledge, however, there is no publicly available data hub, which allows direct linkage of crop production, plants, and insect pollinators. The currently available data in the dataset was obtained from professionally acquired and reviewed data sources such as the Food and Agriculture Organization Corporate Statistical Database (FAOSTAT) and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) as well as data from scientific and technical publications. Works by Klein et al. (Klein, et al., 2007) and Gallai et al. (Gallai, Salle, Settele, & Vaissi\u00e8re, 2009) were used as theoretical basis for the economic importance of pollinators for world crops. The present data set is incomplete and intended to be a starting point for further work (data collection, standardisation and harmonisation) on this topic.

When applied to an [Organism](https:\/\/app.pollinatorhub.eu\/vocabulary\/classes\/7468) or [Occurrence](https:\/\/app.pollinatorhub.eu\/vocabulary\/classes\/7469), this term should be used to represent the scientific name that was applied to the associated [Organism](https:\/\/app.pollinatorhub.eu\/vocabulary\/classes\/7468) in accordance with the [Taxon](https:\/\/app.pollinatorhub.eu\/vocabulary\/classes\/7451) to which it was or is currently identified. Names should be compliant to the most recent nomenclatural code. For example, names of hybrids for algae, fungi and plants should follow the rules of the [International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants](https:\/\/www.iapt-taxon.org\/nomen\/main.php) (Shenzhen Code Articles[ H.1](https:\/\/www.iapt-taxon.org\/nomen\/pages\/main\/art_1.html), [H.2](https:\/\/www.iapt-taxon.org\/nomen\/pages\/main\/art_2.html) and [H.3](https:\/\/www.iapt-taxon.org\/nomen\/pages\/main\/art_3.html)). Thus, use the multiplication sign \u00d7 (Unicode U+00D7, HTML \u00d7) to identify a hybrid, not x or X, if possible.","examples":"* Coleoptera (order)\n* Vespertilionidae (family)\n* Manis (genus)\n* Ctenomys sociabilis (genus + specificEpithet)\n* Ambystoma tigrinum diaboli (genus + specificEpithet + infraspecificEpithet)\n* Roptrocerus typographi (Gy\u00f6rfi, 1952) (genus + specificEpithet + scientificNameAuthorship)\n* Quercus agrifolia var. oxyadenia (Torr.)
