It is based on the deliverable D3.1: Database of Relevant Resources for Honey Bees. The primary goal of BIOEUNIS was to develop a product that improves the spatial precision and accuracy of the EUNIS terrestrial Level 2 habitat plant composition. As a result, we were able to better describe the habitats in terms of their importance as resources for honey bees. To that end, the EUNIS terrestrial Level 2 habitats were divided into biogeographical regions. The BIOEUNIS is a new map of the biogeographical EUNIS terrestrial Level 2 habitats, created as a result of this process. Using the new BIOEUNIS classes, all European vegetation plots in the EVA database were reclassified to these new BIOEUNIS habitat classes by implementing a modified version of the expert system: EUNIS-ESy (Expert system for automatic classification of European vegetation plots to EUNIS habitats, version: 2021-06-01). Using the BIOEUNIS classes, synoptic tables were created to determine the plant composition (occurrence and average cover) of each BIOEUNIS terrestrial Level 2 habitat. The BF Index was recalculated for each BIOEUNIS using the new plant composition of the BIOEUNIS classes and the BF Value of each plant species.","acquisition":"All raw data files were downloaded from the [B-GOOD Bee Health Data Portal](https:\/\/beehealthdata.org) on 2024-09-23 11:47:02.\n\n**List of raw data obtained from the data provider.**\n1.
