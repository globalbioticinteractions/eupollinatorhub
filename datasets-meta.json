The legal basis for NUTS is Regulation (EC) No 1059/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 May 2003 on the establishment of a common classification of territorial units for statistics (NUTS). \n\nNUTS version 2021 has been developed on the basis of the sixth amendment to the annexes, that was adopted by Commission Delegated Regulation 2019/1755, entered into force on 2019-08-08 and applied, with regard to the transmission of data to the Commission (Eurostat), from 2021-01-01. To meet the demand for statistics at a local level, Eurostat maintains a system of Local Administrative Units (LAUs) compatible with NUTS. In addition, since some data collections use postcodes to reference the geographic location, Eurostat has established a link between postcodes and NUTS level 3 codes in order to exploit information which originally is coded only by postcodes.","featured_image":null,"data_overview":null,"data_value":null,"data_description":null,"data_application":null,"data_issues":null,"introduction":null,"acquisition":null,"preparation":null,"validation":null,"analysis":null,"status":"publish","public":true,"licence":{"links":[],"uid":"eurostat","name":"Eurostat","abbreviation":"Eurostat","description":"Eurostat has a policy of encouraging free re-use of its data, both for non-commercial and commercial purposes.

In these circumstances, authorisation must be obtained from the relevant copyright holder(s).\n2.

Trade data originating from Liechtenstein and Switzerland (as declaring countries), from 1995 onwards, and concerning the following commodity classifications: HS, SITC, BEC, NSTR and national commodity classifications. Thus it is, for example, not allowed to sell export/import data declared by Switzerland (concerning the above named commodity classifications). However, it is allowed to sell Swiss export/import data declared by an EU Member State (but see below a similar exception for Austria).\n\te. Trade data originating from Austria (as a declaring country) for a level of detail of the Combined Nomenclature of 8 digits; again, it is not allowed to sell export/import declared by Austria (concerning the above named commodity classifications), but it is allowed to sell Austrian export/import data declared by another EU Member State.\n\n### What to do if you want to re-use Eurostat material for commercial purposes\n\nThere is no special procedure or requirement for a written licence. Just download the material and use it (unless the material is listed in the exceptions above).\n\n### Legal notice of the European Commission\n\nThe basis for the copyright and licence policy of Eurostat is the legal notice of the European Commission 'Europa website' which can be found here: https://ec.europa.eu/info/legal-notice_en\n\n### Political context\n\nThis approach implements the

","data_application":"This data is suited for linking data from existing data hubs such as the Food and Agriculture Organization Corporate Statistical Database (FAOSTAT), national databases containing data on agricultural production, beekeeping and pesticide use, the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) as well as data from scientific and technical publications.

Several databases for crop production and classification as well as animal and plant species taxonomy and occurrence exist. To our knowledge, however, there is no publicly available data hub, which allows direct linkage of crop production, plants, and insect pollinators. The currently available data in the dataset was obtained from professionally acquired and reviewed data sources such as the Food and Agriculture Organization Corporate Statistical Database (FAOSTAT) and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) as well as data from scientific and technical publications. Works by Klein et al. (Klein, et al., 2007) and Gallai et al. (Gallai, Salle, Settele, & Vaissière, 2009) were used as theoretical basis for the economic importance of pollinators for world crops. The present data set is incomplete and intended to be a starting point for further work (data collection, standardisation and harmonisation) on this topic. ","acquisition":"Data from the Food and Agriculture Organization Corporate Statistical Database (FAOSTAT), the statistical data website of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), was obtained on March 29, 2022.

This lack of data is partly due to the fact, that for the great majority of individuals beekeeping is a leisure activity and their considerable economic output is not recorded, partly also due to a lack of awareness for the value of data driven decisions. The current dataset has been collected by the Austrian beekeeping federation *Biene Österreich* to accelerate the production of annual reports on the Austrian beekeeping sector and requires regular manual update.","acquisition":"Data was obtained from several sources by the Austrian beekeeping federation Biene Österreich.

Varroa samples were collected from citizen and mined data using 3 standard method sources between the years 2012-2020. This data contains 11124 varroa sampling events. Roughly 21% of these events record zero mites present. The highest number of mites present in a single sampling event is 5016. Sampling events are collected from 04/02/12 to 11/11/20, and last on average 7.2 days each (range: 1.0-23.8 days). Roughly 75% of Varroa Sampling events occur between 3 and 9 days.\n\nData on mite infestation levels were collected from 3 sources by a standard method - natural mite falls - from 2012 to 2020, mainly in the spring, early summer, and late summer. Data were collected from 3 different sources of differing quality. Data from the highest quality, described as quality_control=2, was examined with the BeeVS diagnostic system (Apisfero, Turin, Italy), which consists of a high-resolution scanner to take a picture of the samples (sticky boards placed under the brood nest of colonies) and cloud-based software used to count the number of mites on the sticky boards. Data from the intermediate source is described as quality_control=1 and were examined manually by a trained group. Data from the poorest quality source is described as quality_control=0 and were examined manually by untrained individuals according to a classification scheme. Data was entered via a web terminal by whomever analyzed the sample. The software vetted the data for plausibility (rejection of values that exceed 100 mites/day) and completeness (rejection of values that did not fall between a 3 day and 21-day measuring interval). Data exceeding these limits, which can be found in the data set, has been imported from external resources and has been approved by the supervisor. The data collected by untrained individuals were checked by the supervisor for plausibility.\n\nFrom 2012 to 2016 the project was only implemented in the Austrian province of Styria, where approximately 3500 beekeepers supervised 53000 to 56000 honeybee colonies. In 2017 the crowdsourcing initiative was extended to all nine Austrian provinces, consisting of 28032 to 30237 beekeepers and 329402 to 390607 honeybee colonies in their care.\n\nThe total number of samples collected is 11124. 4033 (36%) were medium quality samples (QC=1) and 3267 (29%) were high quality samples (QC=2).\n\nThe varroa survey dataset includes 99 users (beekeepers), 242 bee yards (apiaries), and 2,116\nhives from the nine Austrian provinces for a total of 11124 records pertaining to varroa infestation.","featured_image":null,"structure":null,"preparation":null,"changes":null,"unresolved":null,"additional_information":null,"type":"file","licence":null,"columns":[{"links":[],"id":1185,"name":"sampling_id","description":"The sampling event identifier","descriptor":{"links":[],"id":489,"uid":"0.0.MTRLS489","namespace":"dwc","name":"materialSampleID","description":"A term from the [Darwin Core standard](https://dwc.tdwg.org/list/#dwc_materialSampleID):\n\n> An identifier for the [dwc:MaterialSample](https://app.pollinatorhub.eu/vocabulary/classes/7551) (as opposed to a particular digital record of the [dwc:MaterialSample](https://app.pollinatorhub.eu/vocabulary/classes/7551)).

It is based on the deliverable D3.1: Database of Relevant Resources for Honey Bees. The primary goal of BIOEUNIS was to develop a product that improves the spatial precision and accuracy of the EUNIS terrestrial Level 2 habitat plant composition. As a result, we were able to better describe the habitats in terms of their importance as resources for honey bees. To that end, the EUNIS terrestrial Level 2 habitats were divided into biogeographical regions. The BIOEUNIS is a new map of the biogeographical EUNIS terrestrial Level 2 habitats, created as a result of this process. Using the new BIOEUNIS classes, all European vegetation plots in the EVA database were reclassified to these new BIOEUNIS habitat classes by implementing a modified version of the expert system: EUNIS-ESy (Expert system for automatic classification of European vegetation plots to EUNIS habitats, version: 2021-06-01). Using the BIOEUNIS classes, synoptic tables were created to determine the plant composition (occurrence and average cover) of each BIOEUNIS terrestrial Level 2 habitat. The BF Index was recalculated for each BIOEUNIS using the new plant composition of the BIOEUNIS classes and the BF Value of each plant species.","acquisition":"All raw data files were downloaded from the [B-GOOD Bee Health Data Portal](https://beehealthdata.org) on 2024-09-23 11:47:02.\n\n**List of raw data obtained from the data provider.**\n1.

In order to facilitate automated data processing it has been decided to store date and time separately, as the exact time of transmission might be irrelevant.\n3. Column *device* was inserted. Values in column *device* were derived from the header of the values acquired with the respective device in the raw data provided on the [B-GOOD Bee Health Data Portal](https://beehealthdata.org/datasets/48186e29-93de-44c2-8d49-8d29c72857f8)].\n4.

Overall, the B-GOOD datasets ingested into this EUPH dataset lack sufficient metadata and there are a range of other issues that limit compliance with the FAIR principles.\n2. In general, columns are not sufficiently well described (*e.g.* it is unclear, which information is contained in columns *MalpighamoebaCT* and *Malpighamoeba_Notes* related to column *Malpighamoeba*; it is unclear, if the definitions provided for the attributes L, M, H - number of genome copies per bee -, which are used to define the dilution of DNA plasmids, only refer to Viral pathogens or to all pathogens). The provider should provide all information necessary to allow reuse of the data within the dataset.  \n3. For some columns no units are provided (*e.g.* AFB cfu), for other columns, the unit in which data is expressed is not explicitly stated and can only be assumed based on exclusion. The provider should explicitly state the units in columns containing data in order to avoid misunderstandings. \n4. Some of the attributes used in the dataset are not explained (*e.g.* ND). The provider should define the meaning of all attributes used in the dataset.\n5. Data comes in Microsoft Excel files, which occasionally contain nested comments or uncommented annotations (*e.g.* different background colour of cells) in single cells, which makes storage in relational databases difficult and automated processing and analysis impossible.\n6. The table structure does not facilitate data standardisation, as standardisation would require all values measured with the same method to be stored int one single column and transformed to the same unit.\n7. The significance of the string {ND} is unclear:\n* In columns *DWV_Cat*, *EFB_Cat*, *AFB_Cat* (22 records), where column *dataset* = {B-GOOD Pilot B results 2020 for WR V3} and *SampleID* = {BKCSYJMR; JKSXXKSC; LSPSHGZL; MDHLMFYT; NMYRPHNJ; YUXRGDZR; ANYXAYUZ; GNBMNLPM; HFXGDUAU; YPCTFUUU; LJSUAPFC; ZCUPCPFF; KNBULSMH; DUSFMRXB; JTYTGYDP; HXNGCDSH; KSNLKPRT; DRAZTCGC; LYZHDDGB; DXSPRLUC; CYPCTUGX; MJUYMLSH};\n* In column *VarroaBees* and *Varroa_Notes* (7 records), where column *dataset* = {B-GOOD Pilot A results 2020 for BEEP V2} and *SampleID* = {CKTSXSMR; CYXUCRUN; FBYMAGCT; HCHPHKFL; RRBYHJBU; STZPSJHR; UAKMCLMN};\n* In column *VarroaBees* and *Varroa_Notes* (7 records), where column *dataset* = {B-GOOD Pilot A results 2020 for BEEP V2} and *SampleID* = {CKTSXSMR; CYXUCRUN; FBYMAGCT; HCHPHKFL; RRBYHJBU; STZPSJHR; UAKMCLMN};\n* In column *NosemaSpores_Notes* (252 records);\n8.   The significance of the special character {-} in column *AFBcfu*, where dataset = {B-GOOD Pilot A results 2020 for BEEP V2 } and *SampleID* = {UTYBTKUM}, is unclear. Column *AFBcfu_Notes* was replaced by {unknown} until the issue will be resolved.","additional_information":null,"type":"file","licence":null,"columns":[{"links":[],"id":2942,"name":"dataset","description":"Name of the dataset on the [Bee Health Data Portal](https://beehealthdata.org/) from which the data was obtained.","descriptor":{"links":[],"id":315,"uid":"0.0.TEXTA315","namespace":null,"name":"Text","description":"> In computer programming, a string is traditionally a sequence of characters, either as a literal constant or as some kind of variable.

Overall, the B-GOOD datasets ingested into this EUPH dataset lack sufficient metadata and there are a range of other issues that limit compliance with the FAIR principles.\n2. In general, columns are not sufficiently well described (*e.g.* it is unclear, which information is contained in columns *MalpighamoebaCT* and *Malpighamoeba_Notes* related to column *Malpighamoeba*; it is unclear, if the definitions provided for the attributes L, M, H - number of genome copies per bee -, which are used to define the dilution of DNA plasmids, only refer to Viral pathogens or to all pathogens). The provider should provide all information necessary to allow reuse of the data within the dataset.  \n3. For some columns no units are provided (*e.g.* AFB cfu), for other columns, the unit in which data is expressed is not explicitly stated and can only be assumed based on exclusion. The provider should explicitly state the units in columns containing data in order to avoid misunderstandings. \n4. Some of the attributes used in the dataset are not explained (*e.g.* ND). The provider should define the meaning of all attributes used in the dataset.\n5. Data comes in Microsoft Excel files, which occasionally contain nested comments or uncommented annotations (*e.g.* different background colour of cells) in single cells, which makes storage in relational databases difficult and automated processing and analysis impossible.\n6. The table structure does not facilitate data standardisation, as standardisation would require all values measured with the same method to be stored int one single column and transformed to the same unit.\n7. In column *SampleID* the values {GB_1; GB2; GB_3} are not unique. Each of them exists twice.\n8. The significance of the string {ND} is unclear:\n* In column *EFB_Cat* (3 records), where column *dataset* = {Tier2 Field study A results 2022 for BEEP} and *SampleID* = {CDYTBDHK; DTUDJNAG; RYAYUTUG};\n* In column *Varroa_Notes*, where column dataset = {*Varroa_Tier2 Field study results 2021 for WR*} and *SampleID* = {ZUXHUFZP, BXCTGZBN CFO};\n* In columns *AFBcfu_Notes* and *NosemaSpores_Notes*;","additional_information":null,"type":"file","licence":null,"columns":[{"links":[],"id":2990,"name":"dataset","description":"Name of the dataset on the [Bee Health Data Portal](https://beehealthdata.org/) from which the data was obtained.","descriptor":{"links":[],"id":315,"uid":"0.0.TEXTA315","namespace":null,"name":"Text","description":"> In computer programming, a string is traditionally a sequence of characters, either as a literal constant or as some kind of variable.

The Report contains the methodology and an overview of the relevant resources for honey bees. The Database is currently deposited in the B-GOOD data portal (https://beehealthdata.org/) and follows the structure described in section 2.6 of the Report. The Database has the full details about plant species occurrence, average plant species cover and habitat plant species composition, together with the information about the bee-friendliness value of each plant (considering its characteristics independent of the habitat) but also the bee-friendliness of each plant species when considering its occurrence and cover within each habitat. The methods applied for this deliverable are presented and described in the Methodology section of the Report (section 2). After that section, an overview of the main resources for honey bees present in each habitat is shown in the Report (section 3). To contextualise the Deliverable, the integration of Task 3.1 within the entire WP3 strategy is initially explained in a comprehensive workflow diagram of WP3 in the Introduction section of the Report (section 1).\n\nThe main objective of WP3 is to develop a dynamic landscape model across the EU capturing the major floral resources for bees (flower resource model) considered a key driver of bee health status. To achieve this major goal, in task 3.1 the main landscape elements important for bees across Europe were identified and classified in terms of plant composition. In future tasks 3.2 and 3.3 the value in terms of pollen and nectar and phenology will be attributed. To identify the main landscape elements and their composition in terms of plant communities, several data sources and tools were used following the methodology presented in this report.\nIt includes different procedures and data sources aiming to identify the plant composition of each landscape habitat, and to produce a database of major crop, forest and wild species that compose each landscape element type and that are a relevant resource for honey bees. This report and the associated database are the major outputs of task 3.1, and contain the identification and the ranking of plant species and habitats in terms of important resources for honey bees.\n","acquisition":"All raw data files were downloaded from the [B-GOOD Bee Health Data Portal](https://beehealthdata.org) on 2024-09-26 18:15:28.\n\n**List of raw data obtained from the data provider.**\n1.
